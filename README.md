# 🐾 Veni Vici – Cat Explorer

A fun, lightweight React app that lets users discover random cat breeds with images and key facts.  
Each click of the **Discover** button reveals a new cat with its breed name, origin, life span, and temperament.  

Users can click attributes to add them to a **ban list**, filtering out future results that match.  
The ban list appears below the cat info and can be updated by clicking any banned item to remove it.
